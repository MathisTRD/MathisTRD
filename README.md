# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Mathis](https://mattytr.dev), a developer and photographer based in Germany.

I enjoy creating digital experiences that are minimal, expressive, and technically sound â€” whether thatâ€™s a portfolio, a small tool, or a dynamic web app.

Outside of code and design, youâ€™ll find me shooting concerts, capturing the night sky, or playing guitar. Iâ€™m also passionate about music production and cybersecurity.

### Fun Facts:
- Iâ€™m way too into starry skies and get lost easily 
- I build things just for myself 
- Iâ€™m working on a small app to track guitar practice progress
